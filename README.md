# Track. Me. Not.

I've always been fascinated by planes. When introduced to API, I thought, why not make use of fightstats API to checkout the air traffic congestion around the world?

Functionality includes:
  - Toggling to any parts of the world
  - Change of map background (satelite, dark, street view)
  
Build on:
  - Node.JS/Express
  - Leaflet
